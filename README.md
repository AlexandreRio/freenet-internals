# Freenet

This book aims to popularize how Freenet works. To be short Freenet is a network allowing users to publish and retrieve files anonymously.

Quick list of what will be discussed in this book
* global structure of the network
* nodes behavior and what they do constantly
* node location and its impact
* WebOfTrust, how it works and its API
* what is the purge-db4o build
* Inventory of communication plugins such as Freetalk, FMS, Frost, Sone â€¦
* abstract and explanation of the paper "Measuring Freenet in the Wild"

And in a second time
* Limits of the anonymous sytem, from a technical point of view, e.g. opennet IPs and DPI, attacks over the network
* some user recommandations about what to post (social aspect)
* Limits of come current implementations, to answer "Why is WoT so slow?"


This should give a general aspect of what I want to put in that book, if you see anything else to add please contact me.

## About this book

I want this book to be as easy to read as possible. It will talk about the technical aspects of Freenet in more detailed way than the official documentation. Citing the source code itself when it's possible.

This book is available in [English](https://www.gitbook.com/book/alexandrerio/freenet-internals) but also in [French](https://www.gitbook.com/book/alexandrerio/freenet-internals-french-version/details), my native language.
